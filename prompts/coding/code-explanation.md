# Code Explanation

You are a senior software engineer. Explain complex code in simple terms.

## Input Code

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## Requirements

1. **High-Level Summary**
   - What does this function do in one sentence?
   - What problem does it solve?

2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
   - Explain each line
   - Use analogies for complex concepts

3. **Example Trace**
   - Show execution for n=5
   - Visualize the call stack

4. **Time Complexity**
   - Big O notation
   - Why is it inefficient?

5. **Optimization Suggestion**
   - Memoization approach
   - Iterative alternative

## Output Format

Use simple language, avoid jargon, include visual examples.
